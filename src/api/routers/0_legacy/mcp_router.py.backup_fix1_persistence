# BACKUP CREATED BEFORE FIX #1: Conversation State Persistence
# Date: $(date)
# Purpose: Backup before applying conversation state persistence fix

# This backup was created before implementing Fix #1 to resolve the critical issue where
# turn_number was always 1 instead of incrementing properly with conversation persistence.

# Original file: src/api/routers/mcp_router.py
# Issue: turn_number calculated BEFORE registering turn, causing always turn_number = 1
# Fix: Move turn registration BEFORE building final response to get real turn_number
